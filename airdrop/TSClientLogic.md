Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side
development?

-> Solana mostly went with TypeScript for client-side development because it’s something a lot of developers already know, especially those coming from Web2. Since most frontend work today is done in JavaScript or TypeScript, it makes jumping into Web3 much smoother without needing to learn a new language. TypeScript also comes with great tools, type safety, and a huge ecosystem, which helps when building SDKs, CLIs, or dApps. On top of that, writing command-line tools in TS is pretty straightforward, so it’s easier for new developers to get started. Overall, it lowers the entry barrier and makes the shift from Web2 to Web3 a lot more approachable.
